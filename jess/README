                       README for Jess examples
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains simple examples of Jess rule files.  Mot of
these files are just tiny snippets of code used for testing various
Jess features. A few of them are entire programs (zebra.clp,
wordgame.clp, fullmab.clp). Some of them are interactive (sticks.clp,
animal.clp). Don't read too much into them, but they give you an idea
of what a simple rule-based system looks like. hard.clp is an example of a
really badly written rule that is very slow.

To run the animal.clp program, the data file animal.dat must be in the
examples/ subdirctory of your current directory.

browse.clp is an example of the world's smallest Web browser. You might
have to change the URL to get it to work for you. 

console.html is a web page that embeds the Jess generic applet class
jess.ConsoleApplet. 

backchain.clp is a very simple example of the new backwards chaining
facility. 

jframe.clp is a very simple example of building a Swing GUI entirely
from Jess. awtdraw.clp and swingdraw.clpare small GUIs that do
screen-painting in AWT and in Swing.
