; The phase fact indicates the current action to be
; undertaken before the game can begin

; (phase 
;    <action>)      ; Either choose-player or 
                    ; select-pile-size

; The player-select fact contains the human's response to 
; the "Who moves first?" question.

; (player-select
;    <choice>)      ; Valid responses are c (for computer)
                    ; and h (for human).
    
; The pile-select fact contains the human's response to 
; the "How many sticks in the pile?" question.

; (pile-select
;    <choice>)      ; Valid responses are integers 
                    ; greater than zero.

; The pile-size fact contains the current number 
; of sticks in the stack.

; (pile-size
;    <sticks>)      ; An integer greater than zero.

; The player-move fact indicates whose turn it is.

; (player-move
;    <player)       ; Either c (for computer) 
                    ; or h (for human).

; The human-takes fact contains the human's response to 
; the "How many sticks do you wish to take?" question.


; (human-takes
;    <choice>)      ; Valid responses are 1, 2, and 3.

; The take-sticks facts indicate how many sticks the 
; computer should take based on the remainder when the 
; stack size is divided by 4.

(deftemplate take-sticks
   (slot how-many)         ; Number of sticks to take.
   (slot for-remainder))   ; Remainder when stack is
                           ; divided by 4.
